## Hi, there!

I am a PhD student in University of Exeter, I am current working on NLP adversarial attack, etc.

## Here are some demos of my previous works you can try on Huggingface Space:
- [Aspect-based sentiment classification (Multilingual)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yangheng/PyABSA-APC) （English,
  Chinese, etc.）
- [Aspect term extraction & sentiment classification](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yangheng/PyABSA-ATEPC) (English,
  Chinese, Arabic, Dutch, French, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, etc.)
- [方面术语提取和情感分类](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yangheng/PyABSA-ATEPC-Chinese) （中文, etc.）

These demos are powered by [PyABSA](https://github.com/yangheng95/PyABSA), which is one of most easy to use open-source tool for aspect-based sentiment analysis(a.k.a ABSA). PyABSA contains our state-of-the-art models for ABSA, which can be found on [Paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/aspect-based-sentiment-analysis-on-semeval).

## Here are some of my opensource tools may help you
- [PyABSA](https://github.com/yangheng95/PyABSA): State-of-the-art models and simplified interface for ABSA
- [FindFile](https://github.com/yangheng95/findfile): A simple tool to help find your file wherever it locates
- [Autocuda](https://github.com/yangheng95/autocuda): Help your model to find available cuda device without manually `nvidia-smi`
- [Metric-Visualizer](https://github.com/yangheng95/metric_visualizer): Help you to easily make paper beautiful plots
- [ABSADatasets DPT](https://github.com/yangheng95/ABSADatasets/tree/v1.2/DPT): This is a web-based dataset annotation tool which can help you easily make an ABSA dataset and train it using PyABSA.
- [Text Augmentation Tool]: it can aceieve 1-2% or at most 5% absoulte improvement based on existing datasets and models, it will be available after peer-review 
- [More are on the way]
